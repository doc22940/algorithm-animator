# Algorithm Animator
Everytime I think of the time of algorithm learning, it's painful. So, I make this algorithm visualization project to help freshes to learn algorithnm. I will use my spare time to maintain the project, and currently it's interface is a bit ugly, I'll deal with that later.
<br/>Algorithm implemented (in random order):
<br/>**Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**
<br/>Please visit this [GitHub Page](https://luz-alphacode.github.io/algorithm-animator/) for algorithm animations.
<br/>FYI, the animation of the project is based on [*paper-vueify*](https://github.com/luz-alphacode/paper-vueify/), it's an easy-to-use library for converting data to animations.
